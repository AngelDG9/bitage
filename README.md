# Bitage - Crypto Investment Manager

Bitage is a desktop application built with Python and Tkinter that helps you manage and automate cryptocurrency investment strategies. It provides tools for two distinct plan types: **DinamicDCA** for advanced, rule-based investing around an asset's All-Time High (ATH), and **Cryptopips** for simpler, price-target-based strategies.

The application fetches real-time market data, calculates key performance indicators, and provides actionable recommendations based on your predefined rules.
